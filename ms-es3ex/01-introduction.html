This document describes extensions provided by the JScript 5.x language that is implemented in Windows® Internet Explorer® when it loads a document in quirks mode, IE7 mode, or IE8 mode. JScript 5.x is a dialect of ECMAScript. The JScript 5.x dialect is based on the ECMAScript Language Specification 3rd Edition  [ECMA-262], published in 1999.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative and can contain the terms MAY, SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT as defined in RFC 2119. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.

1.1 Glossary 

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as described in  [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.
