1  Introduction

Internet Explorer ECMAScript is a dialect of ECMAScript. The Internet Explorer ECMAScript dialect is based upon the ECMAScript Language Specification (Standard ECMA-262) Fifth Edition  [ECMA- 262/5], published December 2009. This document describes the level of support provided by Internet Explorer ECMAScript for that specification.

The  [ECMA-262/5] specifications contain guidance for authors of webpages, browser users, and user agents (browser applications). This conformance document considers only normative language from the related specifications that applies directly to user agents.

1.1 Glossary 

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as described in  [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2 References 

References to Microsoft Open Specifications documentation do not include a publishing year because links are to the latest version of the technical documents, which are updated frequently. References to other documents include a publishing year when one is available.

1.2.1 Normative References 

We conduct frequent surveys of the normative references to assure their continued availability. If you have any issue with finding a normative reference, please contact  dochelp@microsoft.com. We will assist you in finding the relevant information. Please check the archive site,  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/E4BD6494-06AD-4aed-9823-445E921C9624, as an additional source.

1.3 Microsoft Implementations 

The following Microsoft product implements some portion of the  [ECMA-262/5] specification:

••Windows® Internet Explorer® 9


5 / 47

[MS-ES5] — v20120725

Internet Explorer ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification (Fifth Edition) Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

••Windows® Internet Explorer® 10

In addition, each version of Windows® Internet Explorer® implements multiple document modes, which can vary individually in their support of the standard. The following table lists the document modes available:

Browser Version
Document Modes Supported


Internet Explorer 9
IE9 Mode


Internet Explorer 10
IE9 Mode



Throughout this document, the document mode appears first followed by the browser version in parentheses. Only those document modes and versions of Internet Explorer for which there is a variation note will be listed. If the document mode is not listed, conformance to the specification can be assumed.

1.4 Standards Support Requirements 

To conform to  [ECMA-262/5], a user agent must provide and support all the types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics described in the specification (See  [ECMA- 262/5] section 2, Conformance). Any optional portions that have been implemented must also be implemented as described by the specification. Normative language is usually used to define both required and optional portions. (For more information, see  [RFC2119].)

The following table lists the sections of  [ECMA-262/5] and whether they are considered normative or informative.

1.5 Notation 

The following notations are used in this document to differentiate between notes of clarification, variation from the specification, and points of extensibility.



Notation
Explanation


C####
This identifies a clarification of ambiguity in the target specification. This includes imprecise

statements, omitted information, discrepancies, and errata. This does not include data

formatting clarifications.


V####
This identifies an intended point of variability in the target specification such as the use of

MAY, SHOULD, or RECOMMENDED. (See  [RFC2119].) This does not include extensibility

points.


E####
Because the use of extensibility points (such as optional implementation-specific data) can

impair interoperability, this profile identifies such points in the target specification.
