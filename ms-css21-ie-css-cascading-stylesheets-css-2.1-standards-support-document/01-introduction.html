Internet Explorer Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) 2.1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

1  Introduction

This document describes the level of support provided by Windows® Internet Explorer® for the

Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification  [CSS-Level2-2009], W3C Candidate Recommendation 08 September 2009. CSS is the default style sheet language in Internet Explorer.

Appendix B of this document describes the level of support provided for features in Cascading Style Sheets Level 1  [CSS-Level1-2008] W3C Recommendation 17 Dec 1996, revised 11 Apr 2008. Only requirements that directly conflict with CSS 2.1 features are included.

The  [CSS-Level2-2009] and  [CSS-Level1-2008] specifications contain guidance for authors of webpages and browser users, in addition to user agents (browser applications). Statements found in this document apply only to normative requirements in the specification targeted to user agents, not those targeted to authors.

1.1 Glossary 

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as described in  [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2 References 

References to Microsoft Open Specifications documentation do not include a publishing year because links are to the latest version of the technical documents, which are updated frequently. References to other documents include a publishing year when one is available.

1.2.1 Normative References 

We conduct frequent surveys of the normative references to assure their continued availability. If you have any issue with finding a normative reference, please contact  dochelp@microsoft.com. We will assist you in finding the relevant information. Please check the archive site,  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/E4BD6494-06AD-4aed-9823-445E921C9624, as an additional source.

1.3 Microsoft Implementations 

The following Microsoft products implement some portion of the CSS specification:

••Windows® Internet Explorer® 7
••Windows® Internet Explorer® 8
••Windows® Internet Explorer® 9
••Windows® Internet Explorer® 10

In addition, each version of Windows® Internet Explorer® implements multiple document modes, which can vary individually in their support of the standard. The following table lists the document modes available in each version of Internet Explorer.


Browser Version


Document Modes Supported







Internet Explorer 7


Quirks Mode




Standards Mode




Internet Explorer 8


Quirks Mode




IE7 Mode




IE8 Mode




Internet Explorer 9


Quirks Mode




IE7 Mode




IE8 Mode




IE9 Mode




Internet Explorer 10


Quirks Mode




IE7 Mode




IE8 Mode




IE9 Mode




IE10 Mode







Throughout this document, the document mode appears first followed by the browser version in parentheses. Only those document modes and versions of Internet Explorer for which there is a variation note will be listed. If the document mode is not listed, conformance to the specification can be assumed.

Note "Standards mode" in Internet Explorer 7 and "IE7 mode" in Internet Explorer 8 refer to the same document mode. "IE7 mode" is the preferred way of referring to this document mode across all versions of the browser.

1.4 Standards Support Requirements 

To conform to  [CSS-Level1-2008] or  [CSS-Level2-2009], a user agent must implement all required portions of the specification. Any optional portions that have been implemented must also be implemented as described by the specification. Normative language is usually used to define both required and optional portions. (For more information, see  [RFC2119].)

The following table lists the sections of  [CSS-Level1-2008] and whether they are considered normative or informative.

1.5 Notation 

The following notations are used in this document to differentiate between notes of clarification, variation from the specification, and extension points.



Notation
Explanation


C####
Identifies a clarification of ambiguity in the target specification. This includes imprecise

statements, omitted information, discrepancies, and errata. This does not include data

formatting clarifications.


V####
Identifies an intended point of variability in the target specification such as the use of MAY,

SHOULD, or RECOMMENDED. (See  [RFC2119].) This does not include extensibility points.


E####
Identifies extensibility points (such as optional implementation-specific data) in the target

specification, which can impair interoperability.



For document mode and browser version notation, see section  1.3.
