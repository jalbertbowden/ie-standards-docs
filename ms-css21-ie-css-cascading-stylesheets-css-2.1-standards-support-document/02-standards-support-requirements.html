2  Standards Support Statements

This section contains a full list of variations, clarifications, and extension points in the Microsoft implementation of  [CSS-Level2-2009].

••Section  2.1 includes only those variations that violate a MUST requirement in the target specification.

••Section  2.2 describes further variations from MAY and SHOULD requirements.
••Section  2.3 identifies variations in error handling.
••Section  2.4 identifies variations that impact security.

Section  4, Appendix B, of this document describes variations from requirements in Cascading Style Sheets, level 1  [CSS-Level1-2008] (revised April 11, 2008) that are not in agreement with CSS 2.1 requirements.

2.1 Normative Variations 

The following subsections detail the normative variations from MUST requirements in  [CSS-Level2- 2009].

2.1.1 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.2, Keywords 

V0001:

The specification states:

Keywords have the form of identifiers. Keywords must not be placed between quotes ("..." or '...').

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Quoted keywords are not ignored.

2.1.2 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.3, Characters and case 

V0002:

The specification states:

Note: Backslash escapes are always considered to be part of an identifier or a string (i.e., "\7B" is not punctuation, even though "{" is, and "\32" is allowed at the start of a class name, even though "2" is not).

The identifier "te\st" is exactly the same identifier as "test".

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Backslash escapes are not processed when specifying the url() function name. For example, u\75l('myimage.png') does not resolve to url('myimage.png').

Release: July 25, 2012

2.1.3 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.5, At-rules 

V0003:

The specification states:

CSS 2.1 user agents must ignore any '@import' rule that occurs inside a block or after any non-ignored statement other than an @charset or an @import rule.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The @import rule is not ignored if it follows any valid statement except @charset.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The @import rule is not ignored if it is contained within a block.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The @import rule is ignored after a bad selector, when it should be parsed and executed. All Document Modes (All Versions)

2.1.4 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.2, Rules for handling parsing errors 

V0004:

The specification states:

Illegal values:

User agents must ignore a declaration with an illegal value.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Short-hand properties that contain illegal values are not ignored.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

Invalid characters are allowed in font names.

2.1.5 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.1, Integers and real numbers 

V0005:

The specification states:

Some value types may have integer values (denoted by <integer>) or real number values (denoted by <number>). Real numbers and integers are specified in decimal notation only. An <integer> consists of one or more digits "0" to "9". A <number> can either be an <integer>, or it can be zero or more digits followed by a dot (.) followed by one or more digits. Both integers and real numbers may be preceded by a "-" or "+" to indicate the sign. -0 is equivalent to 0 and is not a negative number.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

[MS-CSS21] — v20120725

Internet Explorer Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) 2.1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

A <number> that has no digits following the dot (.) is allowed. For example, "10.em" is correctly parsed.

2.1.6 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.2, Lengths 

V0006:

The specification states:

The format of a length value (denoted by <length> in this specification) is a <number> (with or without a decimal point) immediately followed by a unit identifier (e.g., px, em, etc.). After a zero length, the unit identifier is optional.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Lengths can be specified in scientific notation; for example, ‘5e2px’ instead of ‘500px’.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Spaces are allowed between <number> and the unit identifier.

2.1.7 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.3, Percentages 

V0007:

The specification states:

The format of a percentage value (denoted by <percentage> in this specification) is a <number> immediately followed by '%'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Percentages can be specified in scientific notation; for example, '5e2px' instead of '500px'.

2.1.8 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.4, URLs and URIs 

C0029:

The specification states:

In order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on the absolute location of a resource, authors may use relative URIs. Relative URIs (as defined in [RFC3986]) are resolved to full URIs using a base URI. RFC 3986, section 5, defines the normative algorithm for this process. For CSS style sheets, the base URI is that of the style sheet, not that of the source document.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Cursor resource paths are relative to the path of document the rule is applied to, not that of the style sheet.

Release: July 25, 2012

2.1.9 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.4, CSS style representation 

V0008:

The specification states:

When a style sheet resides in a separate file, user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a style sheet's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest):

1. An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field (or similar parameters in other protocols) 

2. BOM and/or @charset (see below) 

3. <link charset=""> or other metadata from the linking mechanism (if any) 

4. charset of referring style sheet or document (if any) 

5. Assume UTF-8 

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The priorities are identical, but they follow a different sequence:

1. BOM and/or @charset 

2. Charset of referring style sheet or document (if any) 

3. <link charset=""> or other metadata from the linking mechanism (if any) – the Link charset attribute does not override the referring document’s codepage 

4. An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field (or similar parameters in other protocols) 
– the HTTP charset does not override anything but the default 

5. Assume UTF-8 

All Document Modes (All Versions)

An external style sheet is not abandoned when it starts with a Unicode byte order mark (for example, EF BB BF) and a conflicting ISO @charset declaration. Instead, the style sheet is parsed based on the @charset declaration.

The charset attribute on a link element is ignored.

V0009:

The specification states:

If the encoding is detected based on one of the entries in the table above marked "as specified", the user agent ignores the style sheet if it does not parse an appropriate @charset rule at the beginning of the stream of characters resulting from decoding in the chosen @charset. This ensures that: -@charset rules should only function if they are in the encoding of the style sheet,-byte order marks are ignored only in encodings that support a byte order mark, and-encoding names cannot contain newlines.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Release: July 25, 2012

UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE are not properly supported, but the style sheet is not ignored. Instead, unknown UTF-16BE/LE encodings are converted to UTF-16 and then interpreted as UTF-16.

2.1.10 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.7, Adjacent sibling selectors 

V0010:

The specification states:

Adjacent sibling selectors have the following syntax: E1 + E2, where E2 is the subject of the selector. The selector matches if E1 and E2 share the same parent in the document tree and E1 immediately precedes E2, ignoring non-element nodes (such as text nodes and comments).

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The adjacent sibling selector is not supported; therefore, styling based on this selector is not supported.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Comments are not ignored for adjacent sibling selectors.

2.1.11 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.8.1, Matching attributes and attribute values 

V0011:

The specification states:

Attribute selectors may match in four ways:

[att]

Match when the element sets the "att" attribute, whatever the value of the attribute.

[att=val]

Match when the element's "att" attribute value is exactly "val".

[att~=val]

Represents an element with the att attribute whose value is a white space-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "val". If "val" contains white space, it will never represent anything (since the words are separated by spaces). If "val" is the empty string, it will never represent anything either.

[att|=val]

Represents an element with the att attribute, its value either being exactly "val" or beginning with "val" immediately followed by "-" (U+002D). This is primarily intended to allow language subcode matches (e.g., the hreflang attribute on the a element in HTML) as described in BCP47 ([BCP47]) or its successor. For lang

(or xml:lang) language subcode matching, please see the :lang pseudo-class.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Attribute selectors are not supported.

[MS-CSS21] — v20120725

Internet Explorer Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) 2.1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

The specification states:

Attribute values must be identifiers or strings. The case-sensitivity of attribute names and values in selectors depends on the document language.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Attribute selectors are not supported.

V0013:

The specification states:

Multiple attribute selectors can be used to refer to several attributes of an element, or even several times to the same attribute.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Attribute selectors are not supported.

2.1.12 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.9, ID selectors 

V0014:

The specification states:

If an element has multiple ID attributes, all of them must be treated as IDs for that element for the purposes of the ID selector.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Multiple ID attributes are not supported.

2.1.13 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.11.1, :first-child pseudo-class 

V0015:

The specification states:

The :first-child pseudo-class matches an element that is the first child element of some other element.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The :first-child pseudo class is not supported.

2.1.14 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.11.2, The link pseudo-classes: :link and :visited

V0016:

The specification states:



22 / 248

[MS-CSS21] — v20120725

Internet Explorer Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) 2.1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

User agents commonly display unvisited links differently from previously visited ones. CSS provides the pseudo-classes ':link' and ':visited' to distinguish them:

The :link pseudo-class applies for links that have not yet been visited.

The :visited pseudo-class applies once the link has been visited by the user.

The two states are mutually exclusive.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The :link pseudo-class and the :visited pseudo-class are not mutually exclusive.

2.1.15 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.11.4, The language pseudo-class: :lang 

V0017:

The specification states:

The pseudo-class ':lang(C)' matches if the element is in language C. Whether there is a match is based solely on the identifier C being either equal to, or a hyphen-separated substring of, the element's language value, in the same way as if performed by the '|=' operator. The matching of C against the element's language

value is performed case-insensitively for characters within the ASCII range. The identifier C does not have to be a valid

language name.

C must not be empty.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The pseudo-class :lang is not supported.

2.1.16 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.12.1, The :first-line pseudo-element 

V0018:

The specification states:

The "first formatted line" of an element may occur inside a block-level descendant in the same flow (i.e., a block-level descendant that is not positioned and not a float). E.g., the first line of the DIV in <DIV><P>This line...</P></DIV> is the first line of the P (assuming that both P and DIV are block-level).

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The first line does not match when the first line of the element belongs to a block-level descendant of the element.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

If the first line of an inline-block matches :first-line, all the lines of the inline-block also match

:first-line.

All Document Modes (All Versions)



23 / 248

[MS-CSS21] — v20120725

Internet Explorer Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) 2.1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

Elements contained within a parent of a :first-line pseudo-element incorrectly inherit from the parent element instead of the :first-line pseudo-element.

V0019:

The specification states:

The first line of a table-cell or inline-block cannot be the first formatted line of an ancestor element. Thus, in <DIV><P STYLE="display: inline-block">Hello<BR> Goodbye</P> etcetera</DIV> the first formatted line of the DIV is not the line "Hello".

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The :first-line pseudo-element is not supported for the first line of an inline-block.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

:first-line incorrectly applies to inline-block children of a block parent; moreover, the :first-line style is applied to the entire content of the inline-block child.

2.1.17 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.12.2, The :first-letter pseudo-element 

V0020:

The specification states:

These are the properties that apply to :first-letter pseudo-elements: font properties, 'text-decoration', 'text-transform', 'letter-spacing', 'word-spacing' (when appropriate), 'line-height', 'float', 'vertical-align' (only if 'float' is 'none'), margin properties, padding properties, border properties, color property, background properties. UAs may apply other properties as well. To allow UAs to render a typographically correct drop cap or initial cap, the UA may choose a line-height, width and height based on the shape of the letter, unlike for normal elements. CSS3 is expected to have specific properties that apply to first-letter.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The float, letter-spacing, padding, and line-height properties are not supported.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border property is applied to the bottom border; the bottom border is clipped at the content edge.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

:first-letter when used in combination with float and text-transform: capitalize causes the second letter to become capitalized.

V0021:

The specification states:

Punctuation (i.e, characters defined in Unicode [UNICODE] in the "open" (Ps), "close" (Pe), "initial" (Pi). "final" (Pf) and "other" (Po) punctuation classes),

that precedes or follows the first letter should be included.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Punctuation characters defined in Unicode that precede or follow the first letter are not included.

V0022:

The specification states:

Some languages may have specific rules about how to treat certain letter combinations. In Dutch, for example, if the letter combination "ij" appears at the beginning of a word, both letters should be considered within the :first-letter pseudo-element.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Letter combinations are not considered for the purpose of :first-letter pseudo-element matching.

2.1.18 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.12.3, The :before and :after pseudo-elements 

V0023:

The specification states:

The ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements can be used to insert generated content before or after an element's content.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The :before and :after pseudo-elements are not supported.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The :before and :after pseudo-elements have no effect on link elements.

2.1.19 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 6.2.1, The 'inherit' value 

V0024:

The specification states:

Each property may also have a specified value of 'inherit', which means that, for a given element, the property takes the same computed value as the property for the element's parent. The 'inherit' value can be used to strengthen inherited values, and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The inherit value is supported only for the visibility and the direction properties.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The inherit keyword does not inherit computed values from parent elements.

Release: July 25, 2012

The inherit keyword does not inherit from a style that has been dynamically changed.

2.1.20 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 6.3, The @import rule 

V0025:

The specification states:

The '@import' rule allows users to import style rules from other style sheets. In CSS 2.1, any @import rules must precede all other rules (except the @charset rule, if present). See the section on parsing for when user agents must ignore @import rules. The '@import' keyword must be followed by the URI of the style sheet to include. A string is also allowed; it will be interpreted as if it had url(...) around it.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The @import rule is not ignored if it does not precede all other rules (except the @charset rule, if present).

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

@import rules allow invalid characters in font names.

The @import rule is ignored when the print media type is specified.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

@import rules are applied only from style sheets that are linked three levels deep. V0026:

The specification states:

A target medium matches a media list if one of the items in the media list is the target medium or 'all'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The target medium must match one of the items in the media list. The all specifier is not supported.

2.1.21 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 6.4.3, Calculating a selector's specificity 

V0027:

The specification states:

A selector's specificity is calculated as follows:

count 1 if the declaration is from is a 'style' attribute rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= a) (In HTML, values of an element's "style" attribute are style sheet rules. These rules have no selectors, so a=1, b=0, c=0, and d=0.) count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= b)

count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= c)

count the number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= d)

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The following selectors and selector features are not supported:

••All attribute selectors
••Adjacent sibling and sibling combinators
••The :active, :first-child, :focus, and :lang pseudo-classes
••The :after, :before, :first-letter, and :first-line pseudo-elements
••@page :first, @page :left, and @page :right

The rules are not applied and the selector specificity is zero.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The specificity of a selector that ends with a pseudo-element is capped at two no matter how many parent elements precede it.

2.1.22 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 6.4.4, Precedence of non-CSS presentational hints

V0028:

The specification states:

The UA may choose to honor presentational attributes in an HTML source document. If so, these attributes are translated to the corresponding CSS rules with specificity equal to 0, and are treated as if they were inserted at the start of the author style sheet. They may therefore be overridden by subsequent style sheet rules. In a transition phase, this policy will make it easier for stylistic attributes to coexist with style sheets.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The cellspacing, frame, rules, framebar, hspace, and vspace attributes are not overridden by subsequent style sheet rules.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

The noshade attribute is not overridden by subsequent style sheet rules.

2.1.23 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 7.2.1, The @media rule 

V0029:

The specification states:

Style rules outside of @media rules apply to all media types that the style sheet applies to. At-rules inside @media are invalid in CSS2.1.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

At-rules inside the @media rule are not ignored. For example, if an @media appears inside an @media rule, the declarations within are applied to the document.

2.1.24 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 7.3, Recognized media types 

V0030:

The specification states:

Media type names are case-insensitive.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Media type names are case-sensitive.

V0031:

The specification states:

@media and @import rules with unknown media types (that are nonetheless valid identifiers) are treated as if the unknown media types are not present. If an @media/@import rule contains a malformed media type (not an identifier) then the statement is invalid.

Note: Media Queries supercedes this error handling.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The @import rule does not ignore unknown media types. In the case of an unknown media type, the @import rules fail.

2.1.25 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 8.1, Box dimensions 

V0032:

The specification states:

content edge or inner edge

The content edge surrounds the rectangle given by the width and height of the box, which often depend on the element's rendered content. The four content edges define the box's content box.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The content edge surrounds content, padding, and border.

V0033:

The specification states:

padding edge

The padding edge surrounds the box padding. If the padding has 0 width, the padding

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The content edge surrounds content, padding, and border.

V0034:

The specification states:

border edge

The border edge surrounds the box's border. If the border has 0 width, the border edge is the same as the padding edge. The four border edges define the box's border box.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The border edge is equal to the content box. The width of the border is subtracted from the area available for content and padding.

2.1.26 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 8.3, Margin properties: 'margin-top', 'margin-right', 'margin-bottom', 'margin-left', and 'margin'

When a parent element has a percentage-based padding value specified (for example, padding-top: 10%) and a child element has a vertical margin specified (for example, margin-top:100px), the vertical margin is ignored by the child element and then applied to the parent element instead.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The width of shrink-to-fit elements is incorrect when children elements have width and horizontal percentage-based margins.

Content outside the page box is discarded when negative margins are used.

2.1.27 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 8.3.1, Collapsing margins 

V0038:

The specification states:

If the top and bottom margins of a box are adjoining, then it is possible for margins to collapse through it. In this case, the position of the element depends on its relationship with the other elements whose margins are being collapsed.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

If the top and bottom margins of a box are adjoining, the box prevents margins from collapsing through it.

Note In Internet Explorer 7, parent elements that have "layout" can cause child elements to collapse margins and padding incorrectly. An element that sets hasLayout is responsible for sizing and arranging its own content. For more information, see  [MSDN-HasLayout].

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Table and caption margins do not collapse when the table's parent is floated.

V0039:

Margin collapsing is prevented when one of the following conditions is true:

••The element has a specified width and/or height
••The element is an inline-block
••The element is absolutely positioned
••The element is a float
••The element is a table
••The element is transformed – e.g. style = "zoom:1"

Note In Internet Explorer 7, any of the preceding conditions will cause an element to gain "layout." An element that sets hasLayout is responsible for sizing and arranging its own content. For more information, see  [MSDN-HasLayout].

'direction' Value: ltr | rtl | inherit Initial: ltr

Applies to: all elements, but see prose Inherited: yes

Percentages: N/A Media: visual

Computed value: as specified

This property specifies the base writing direction of blocks and the direction of embeddings and overrides (see 'unicode-bidi') for the Unicode bidirectional algorithm. In addition, it specifies the direction of table column layout, the direction of horizontal overflow, and the position of an incomplete last line in a block in case of 'text-align: justify'.

Values for this property have the following meanings:

ltr

Left-to-right direction.

rtl

Right-to-left direction.

For the 'direction' property to affect reordering in inline elements, the 'unicode-bidi' property's value must be 'embed' or 'override'.

 Note. The 'direction' property, when specified for table column elements, is not inherited by cells in the column since columns are not the ancestors of the cells in the document tree. Thus, CSS cannot easily capture the "dir" attribute inheritance rules described in [HTML4], section 11.3.2.1.

2.1.34 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.2.1.1, Anonymous block boxes 

V0050:

The specification states:

When an inline box contains an in-flow block-level box, the inline box (and its inline ancestors within the same line box) are broken around the block-level box (and any block-level siblings that are consecutive or separated only by collapsible whitespace and/or out-of-flow elements), splitting the inline box into two boxes (even if either side is empty), one on each side of the block-level box(es). The line boxes before the break and after the break are enclosed in anonymous block boxes, and the block-level box becomes a sibling of those anonymous boxes. When such an inline box is affected by relative positioning, any resulting translation also affects the block-level box contained in the inline box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The inline box is not broken around the contained block.

V0051:

The specification states:

Some user agents have implemented borders on inlines containing blocks in other ways, e.g., by wrapping such nested blocks inside "anonymous line boxes" and thus drawing inline borders around such boxes. As CSS1 and CSS2 did not define this behavior, CSS1-only and CSS2-only user agents may implement this alternative model and still claim conformance to this part of CSS 2.1. This does not apply to UAs developed after this specification was released.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Borders are rendered by wrapping blocks contained in inline boxes inside "anonymous line boxes" so that inline borders are drawn around the inline boxes.

The inherit value of the position property is not supported.

C0030:

The specification states:

relative

The box's position is calculated according to the normal flow (this is called the position in normal flow). Then the box is offset relative to its normal position. When a box B is relatively positioned, the position of the following box is calculated as though B were not offset. The effect of 'position:relative' on table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group, table-row, table-column-group, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.

Quirks Mode, IE8 Mode, and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

When an inline element breaks across lines, the top, right, bottom and left properties are relative to those of the first linebox.

V0059:

The specification states:

Fixed

The box's position is calculated according to the 'absolute' model, but in addition, the box is fixed with respect to some reference. As with the 'absolute'

model, the box's margins do not collapse with any other margins… UAs must not paginate the content of fixed boxes. Note that UAs may print invisible

content in other ways.

The specification states:

Floats, absolutely positioned elements, block containers (such as inline-blocks, table-cells, and table-captions) that are not block boxes, and block boxes with 'overflow' other than 'visible' (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••When overflow is set to something other than visible, table-cell elements do not establish new block formatting contexts.

••When overflow is set to visible, table-cell elements establish a new block formatting context.

2.1.39 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.4.2, Inline formatting context 

V0063:

The specification states:

In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Right padding is ignored between inline formatted boxes.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

Padding is lost after line breaks on inline level elements that contain block-level elements. V0064:

The specification states:

When an inline box exceeds the width of a line box, it is split into several boxes and these boxes are distributed across several line boxes. If an inline box cannot be split (e.g., if the inline box contains a single character, or language specific word breaking rules disallow a break within the inline box, or if the inline box is affected by a white-space value of nowrap or pre), then the inline box overflows the line box.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

If an inline box cannot be split, then both the inline box and the line box overflow.

2.1.40 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.4.3, Relative positioning 

V0065:

The specification states:

Once a box has been laid out according to the normal flow or floated, it may be shifted relative to this position. This is called relative positioning. Offsetting a box (B1) in this way has no effect on the box (B2) that follows: B2 is given a position as if B1 were not offset and B2 is not re-positioned after B1's offset is applied. This implies that relative positioning may cause boxes to overlap. However, if relative positioning causes an 'overflow:auto' or 'overflow:scroll' box to have overflow, the UA must allow the user to access this content (at its offset position), which, through the creation of scrollbars, may affect layout.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••A container with overflow set to auto does not provide a scroll bar for relatively positioned content, nor does it allow the user to access this content.

••A container with overflow set to scroll provides a scroll bar but does not contain the overflowed content. The user cannot access the overflowed content.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••A container with overflow set to auto does not provide a scroll bar; instead, the content bleeds outside the container.

••A container with overflow set to scroll provides a scroll bar but does not contain the overflowed content. The overflowed content bleeds outside the container (outside the scrollable section).

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

A container with overflow set to scroll causes the height of that container to become the value of the max-height property even when it is not necessary.

2.1.41 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.5, Floats 

V0066:

The specification states:

A float is a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line. The most interesting characteristic of a float (or "floated" or "floating" box) is that content may flow along its side (or be prohibited from doing so by the 'clear' property). Content flows down the right side of a left-floated box and down the left side of a right-floated box.

Content before the float in tree order does not flow to the left side of a right-floated element. In addition, the content does not flow to the right side of a left-floated element. As a result, the float is moved to the next line.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

An absolutely positioned element generates an in-flow anonymous inline element if it is the last child of an inline element.

V0067:

The specification states:

If there is a line box, the outer top of the floated box is aligned with the top of the current line box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Floats do not align with the current line box. Instead, they create a new line box on the next line. V0068:

The specification states:

Since a float is not in the flow, non-positioned block boxes created before and after the float box flow vertically as if the float did not exist. However, line boxes created next to the float are shortened to make room for the margin box of the float.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••Block boxes are flowed around floats.

••Floats are not placed on the same line box as previous inline content. Instead, they are placed on a new line.

V0069:

The specification states:

If a shortened line box is too small to contain any further content, then it is shifted downward until either it fits or there are no more floats present. Any content in the current line before a floated box is reflowed in the first available line on the other side of the float. In other words, if inline-level boxes are placed on the line before a left float is encountered that fits in the remaining line box space, the left float is placed on that line, aligned with the top of the line box, and then the inline-level boxes already on the line are moved accordingly to the right of the float (the right being the other side of the left float) and vice versa for rtl and right floats.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Floats are moved to a new line instead of interacting with the text of a previous line.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

A positioned element that is the child of a floated element does not take part in the stacking context of the parent.

2.1.44 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.6.1, Fixed positioning 

V0079:

The specification states:

Fixed positioning is a subcategory of absolute positioning. The only difference is that for a fixed positioned box, the containing block is established by the viewport. For continuous media, fixed boxes do not move when the document is scrolled. In this respect, they are similar to fixed background images. For paged media, boxes with fixed positions are repeated on every page. This is useful for

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The fixed value of the position property is not supported.

2.1.45 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.9.1, Specifying the stack level: the 'z-index' property

V0080:

The specification states:

z-index

Value:	auto | <integer> | inherit

Initial:	auto

Applies to:	positioned elements

Inherited:	no

Percentages:	N/A

Media:	visual

Computed value:	as specified

For a positioned box, the 'z-index' property specifies:

The stack level of the box in the current stacking context.

Whether the box establishes a stacking context.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The initial value of the z-index property is 0.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The z-index property resolves large negative values (such as -2147483646) to 'auto'.

The z-index property accepts number values and percentage values instead of only allowing integers.

V0081:

The specification states:

Auto

The stack level of the generated box in the current stacking context is '0'. The box does not establish a new stacking context unless it is the root element.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The auto value is mapped to '0' so that the initial value of the z-index property is '0'.

Release: July 25, 2012

The specification states:

The root element forms the root stacking context. Other stacking contexts are generated by any positioned element (including relatively positioned elements) having a computed value of 'z-index' other than 'auto'. Stacking contexts are not necessarily related to containing blocks.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Assigning an element a relative, absolute, or fixed position generates a stacking context.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Assigning an element a relative or absolute position generates a stacking context.

2.1.46 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.2, Content width: the 'width' property 

V0083:

The specification states:

<percentage>

Specifies a percentage width. The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block. If the containing block's width depends on this element's width, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1. Note: For absolutely positioned elements whose containing block is based on a block-level element, the percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the padding box of that element. This is a change from CSS1, where the percentage width was always calculated with respect to the content box of the parent element.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The percentage is calculated with respect to the content box of the parent element. In addition, the box model includes borders, padding, and content widths.

2.1.47 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.3.3, Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow

V0084:

The specification states:

If all of the above have a computed value other than 'auto', the values are said to be "over-constrained" and one of the used values will have to be different from its computed value. If the 'direction' property of the containing block has the value 'ltr', the specified value of 'margin-right' is ignored and the value is calculated so as to make the equality true. If the value of 'direction' is 'rtl', this happens to 'margin-left' instead.

Release: July 25, 2012

When one or more of the listed properties are "over-constrained" and the value of the direction property is ltr, the margin-right property is not adjusted. Instead, both margins and paddings are applied and the content box is reduced.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The value of the margin-left property is not recalculated and the value for margin-right is not set to 0 when the direction property is set to rtl.

2.1.48 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.3.7, Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements

V0085:

The specification states:

5. 'width' is 'auto', 'left' and 'right' are not 'auto', then solve for 'width'

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

Absolutely positioned elements cannot be sized by their right and left values. They must have either an intrinsic or specified width.

2.1.49 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.6.4, Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements

V0086:

The specification states:

If all three of 'top', 'height', and 'bottom' are auto, set 'top' to the static position and apply rule number three below.

If none of the three are 'auto': If both 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins get equal values. If one of 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' is 'auto', solve the equation for that value. If the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for 'bottom' and solve for that value.

Otherwise, pick the one of the following six rules that applies.

1.'top' and 'height' are 'auto' and 'bottom' is not 'auto', then the height is based on the content, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'top'

2. 'top' and 'bottom' are 'auto' and 'height' is not 'auto', then set 'top' to the static position, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'bottom' 

3. 'height' and 'bottom' are 'auto' and 'top' is not 'auto', then the height is based on the content, set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'bottom' 

4. 'top' is 'auto', 'height' and 'bottom' are not 'auto', then set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0, and solve for 'top' 

5. 'height' is 'auto', 'top' and 'bottom' are not 'auto', then 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are set to 0 and solve for 'height' 

6. 'bottom' is 'auto', 'top' and 'height' are not 'auto', then set 'auto' values for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' to 0 and solve for 'bottom'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

If none of the three properties (top, height, and bottom) are set to auto and if both margin-top and margin-bottom are auto, then margin-top is set to 0 and the equation is solved for margin-bottom.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The following variations occur in this mode:

••If none of the three properties (top, height, and bottom) are set to auto and when margin-top is auto and margin-bottom is not, margin-top is set to 0 and the equation is solved for margin-bottom.

••Rule 5: When Height is auto and top and bottom are not auto, then the auto values for margin-top and margin-bottom are set to 0, height is set to minimum height (the current line height) and the equation is solved for bottom.

2.1.50 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.6.7, 'Auto' heights for block formatting context roots

V0087:

The specification states:

In addition, if the element has any floating descendants whose bottom margin edge is below the element's bottom content edge, then the height is increased to include those edges. Only floats that participate in this block formatting context are taken into account, e.g., floats inside absolutely positioned descendants or other floats are not.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The block formatting context container does not expand its height to accommodate the bottom margin of its floating content.

2.1.51 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.7, Minimum and maximum heights: 'min-height' and 'max-height'

V0088:

The specification states:

<percentage>

Specifies a percentage for determining the used value. The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the percentage value is treated as '0' (for 'min-height') or 'none' (for 'max-height').

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The min-height property is not supported.

Release: July 25, 2012

The specification states:

It is sometimes useful to constrain the height of elements to a certain range. Two properties offer this functionality:

'min-height'

Value:	<length> | <percentage> | inherit

Initial:	0

Applies to:	all elements but non-replaced inline elements, table columns, and
column groups

Inherited:	no

Percentages:	see prose

Media:	visual

Computed value:	the percentage as specified or the absolute length

'max-height'

Value:	<length> | <percentage> | none | inherit

Initial:	0

Applies to:	all elements but non-replaced inline elements, table columns, and
column groups

Inherited:	no

Percentages:	see prose

Media:	visual

Computed value:	the percentage as specified or the absolute length

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The min-height and max-height properties are not supported.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The inherit value of the max-height and min-height properties is not supported.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The max-height property is ignored when position is absolute. Only the value of the height property is used in the calculation and not the max-height.

2.1.52 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.8, Line height calculations: the 'line-height' and 'vertical-align' properties

V0090:

The specification states:

As described in the section on inline formatting contexts, user agents flow inline-level boxes into a vertical stack of line boxes. The height of a line box is determined as follows:

 1.The height of each inline-level box in the line box is calculated (see "Calculating heights and margins" and the 'line-height' property).

 2.The inline-level boxes are aligned vertically according to their 'vertical-align' property. In case they are aligned 'top' or 'bottom', they must be aligned so as to minimize the line box height. If such boxes are tall enough, there are multiple solutions and CSS 2.1 does not define the position of the line box's baseline (i.e., the position of the strut, see below).

 3.The line box height is the distance between the uppermost box top and the lowermost box bottom. (This includes the strut, as explained under 'line-height'

below.)

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

In almost standards mode, step 4 is not followed. The line box height remains the distance between the uppermost box top and the lowermost box bottom.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The É (&Eacute;) character does not align properly when vertical-align is set to anything other than baseline.

V0091:

The specification states:

Empty inline elements generate empty inline boxes, but these boxes still have margins, padding, borders and a line height, and thus influence these calculations just like elements with content.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Empty inline elements have no effect on the page layout regardless of their computed margins, paddings, borders, and line heights.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

In almost standards mode, empty elements do not influence line height calculations.

2.1.53 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.8.1, Leading and half-leading 

V0092:

The specification states:

CSS assumes that every font has font metrics that specify a characteristic height above the baseline and a depth below it. In this section we use A to mean that height (for a given font at a given size) and D the depth. We also define AD = A + D, the distance from the top to the bottom. (See the note below for how to find A and D for TrueType and OpenType fonts.) Note that these are metrics of the font as a whole and need not correspond to the ascender and descender of any individual glyph.

User agent must align the glyphs in a non-replaced inline box to each other by their relevant baselines, and to nested inline boxes according to 'vertical-align'. Then, for each glyph, determine the A and D. Note that glyphs in a single element may come from different fonts and thus need not all have the same A and D. If the inline box contains no glyphs at all, it is considered to contain a strut (an invisible glyph of zero width) with the A and D of the element's first available font.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

When the value of line-height is less than the content height, the portion of the font that would pass below the bottom edge of the content box is clipped and does not bleed outside of the box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The inherit value of the line-height property is not supported.

V0094:

The specification states:

On a block container element whose content is composed of inline-level elements, 'line-height' specifies the minimal height of line boxes within the element. The minimum height consists of a minimum height above the baseline and a minimum depth below it, exactly as if each line box starts with a zero-width inline box with the element's font and line height properties. We call that imaginary box a "strut." (The name is inspired by TeX.)

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

In almost standards mode, line-height does not define a minimal line height for inline content in block-level, table-cell, table-caption, or inline-block elements.

V0095:

The specification states:

On an inline-level element, 'line-height' specifies the height that is used in the calculation of the line box height (except for inline replaced elements, where the height of the box is given by the 'height' property).

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

In almost standards mode, the specified line-height has no effect on line box height calculation.

The outside value of the list-style-position property is not supported when used in combination with any value of the overflow property other than visible.

V0122:

The specification states:

Outside

The marker box is outside the principal block box. The position of the list-item marker adjacent to floats is undefined in CSS 2.1 CSS 2.1 does not specify the precise location of the marker box or its position in the painting order, but does require that for list items whose 'direction' property is 'ltr' the marker box be on the left side of the content and for elements whose 'direction' property is 'rtl' the marker box be on the right side of the content. The marker box is fixed with respect to the principal block box's border and does not scroll with the principal block box's content. In CSS 2.1, a UA may hide the marker if the element's 'overflow' is other than 'visible'. (This is expected to change in the future.) The size or contents of the marker box may affect the height of the principal block box and/or the height of its first line box, and in some cases may cause the creation of a new line box. Note: This interaction may be more precisely defined in a future level of CSS.

IE8 Mode (Internet Explorer 8)

The marker box is not rendered when the overflow property is set to scroll.

2.1.65 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 13.2.1, Page margins 

V0124:

The specification states:

The page context has no notion of fonts, so 'em' and 'ex' units are not allowed. Percentage values on the margin properties are relative to the dimensions of the page box; for left and right margins, they refer to the width of the page box while for top and bottom margins, they refer to the height of the page box. All other units associated with the respective CSS 2.1 properties are allowed.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••Margin properties that have values in inches, centimeters, or pixels are not supported.
••Percentage values on margin properties are not supported.

2.1.66 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 13.2.2, Page selectors: selecting left, right, and first pages

V0125:

The specification states:

All pages are automatically classified by user agents into either the :left or :right pseudo-class. Whether the first page of a document is :left or :right depends on the major writing direction of the root element. For example, the first page of a document with a left-to-right major writing direction would be a :right page, and the first page of a document with a right-to-left major writing direction would be a :left page. To explicitly force a document to begin printing on a left or right page, authors can insert a page break before the first generated box.

@page :left { margin-left: 4cm; margin-right: 3cm;

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The @page :first rule is not supported.

V0127:

The specification states:

Margin declarations on left, right, and first pages may result in different page area widths. To simplify implementations, user agents may use a single page area width on left, right, and first pages. In this case, the page area width of the first page should be used.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The :left, :right, and :first pseudo classes are not supported.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The page area width of the first page is used.

2.1.67 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 13.2.3, Content outside the page box 

V0128:

The specification states:

The exact formatting of such elements lies outside the scope of this specification. However, we recommend that user agents observe the following general principles concerning content outside the page box:

* Content should be allowed slightly beyond the page box to allow pages to "bleed". 

* User agents should avoid generating a large number of empty page boxes to honor the positioning of elements (e.g., you do not want to print 100 blank pages).

Rule A: Breaking at (1) is allowed only if the 'page-break-after' and 'page-break-before' properties of all the elements generating boxes that meet at this margin allow it, which is when at least one of them has the value 'always', 'left', or 'right', or when all of them are 'auto'.

Rule B: However, if all of them are 'auto' and a common ancestor of all the elements has a 'page-break-inside' value of 'avoid', then breaking here is not allowed.

Rule C: Breaking at (2) is allowed only if the number of line boxes between the break and the start of the enclosing block box is the value of 'orphans' or more, and the number of line boxes between the break and the end of the box is the value of 'widows' or more.

Rule D: In addition, breaking at (2) or (3) is allowed only if the 'page-break-inside' property of the element and all its ancestors is 'auto'.

When specified on or propagated to an inline element, it affects all the boxes generated by that element, and is further propagated to any in-flow block-level boxes that split the inline (see section 9.2.1.1). For block containers that establish an inline formatting context, the decorations are propagated to an anonymous inline element that wraps all the in-flow inline-level children of the block container.

The pre-line and pre-wrap values of the white-space property are not supported.

2.1.82 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 16.6.1, The 'white-space' processing model 

V0158:

The specification states:

1. Each tab (U+0009), carriage return (U+000D), or space (U+0020) character surrounding a linefeed (U+000A) character is removed if 'white-space' is set to 'normal', 'nowrap', or 'pre-line'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The pre-line value of the white-space property is not supported.

V0159:

The specification states:

3. If a space (U+0020) at the end of a line has 'white-space' set to 'normal', 'nowrap', or 'pre-

line', it is also removed.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

White space at the end of the line is not removed.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The trailing white space of an inline element with a closing border is collapsed to one space (U+0020).

2.1.83 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 16.6.2, Example of bidirectionality with white space collapsing

V0499:

The specification states:

Given the following markup fragment, taking special note of spaces (with varied backgrounds and borders for emphasis and identification):


<ltr>A <rtl> B </rtl> C</ltr>

Release: July 25, 2012

...where the <ltr> element represents a left-to-right embedding and the <rtl> element represents a right-to-left embedding, and assuming that the 'white-space' property is set to 'normal', the above processing model would result in the following:

The space before the B ( ) would collapse with the space after the A ( ). The space before the C ( ) would collapse with the space after the B ( ).

This would leave two spaces, one after the A in the left-to-right embedding level, and one after the B in the right-to-left embedding level. This is then rendered according to the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, with the end result being:

A  BC

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The Unicode 'RIGHT-TO-LEFT-OVERRIDE' (U+202E) character changes the position of surrounding white space, thus affecting white-space collapsing.

2.1.84 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.1, Introduction to tables 

V0160:

The specification states:

Authors may specify the visual formatting of a table as a rectangular grid of cells. Rows and columns of cells may be organized into row groups and column groups. Rows, columns, row groups, column groups, and cells may have borders drawn around them (there are two border models in CSS 2.1). Authors may align data vertically or horizontally within a cell and align data in all cells of a row or column.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border property is not supported for the following elements:

••table-column
••table-column-group
••table-row
••table-row-group

2.1.85 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.3, Columns 

V0161:

The specification states:

‘border'

The various border properties apply to columns only if 'border-collapse' is set to 'collapse' on the table element. In that case, borders set on columns and column groups are input to the conflict resolution algorithm that selects the border styles at every cell edge.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Release: July 25, 2012

The border properties are not supported for columns and column groups; however, both collapsing and separated border modes are supported.

V0162:

The specification states:

'background'

The background properties set the background for cells in the column, but only if both the cell and row have transparent backgrounds. See "Table layers and transparency."

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••The background properties of the display table types table-column and table-column-group are not supported

••The table-column and table-column-group values of the display property are not supported.

V0163:

The specification states:

'visibility'

If the 'visibility' of a column is set to 'collapse', none of the cells in the column are rendered, and cells that span into other columns are clipped. In addition, the width of the table is diminished by the width the column would have taken up. See "Dynamic effects" below. Other values for 'visibility' have no effect.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The visibility property is not supported for columns and column groups.

2.1.86 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.2, Table width algorithms: the 'table-layout' property

V0164:

The specification states:

If the margins of a table are set to '0' and the width to 'auto', the table will not automatically size to fill its containing block. However, once the calculated value of 'width' for the table is found (using the algorithms given below or, when appropriate, some other UA dependent algorithm) then the other parts of section 10.3 do apply. Therefore a table can be centered using left and right 'auto' margins, for instance.

The inherit value of the table-layout property is not supported.

2.1.87 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.2.1, Fixed table layout 

V0166:

The specification states:

The table's width may be specified explicitly with the 'width' property. A value of 'auto' (for both 'display: table' and 'display: inline-table') means use the automatic table layout algorithm. However, if the table is a block-level table ('display: table') in normal flow, a UA may (but does not have to) use the algorithm of 10.3.3 to compute a width and apply fixed table layout even if the specified width is 'auto'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Setting the value of the width property to auto does not override table-layout:fixed. The table will still use fixed layout.

2.1.88 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.3, Table height algorithms 

V0167:

The specification states:

The baseline of a cell is the baseline of the first in-flow line box in the cell, or the first in-flow table-row in the cell, whichever comes first. If there is no such line box or table-row, the baseline is the bottom of content edge of the cell box. For the purposes of finding a baseline, in-flow boxes with a scrolling mechanisms (see the 'overflow' property) must be considered as if scrolled to their origin position. Note that the baseline of a cell may end up below its bottom border, see the example below.

Computed value:	two absolute lengths

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border-spacing property is not supported.

V0169:

The specification states:

The distance between the table border and the borders of the cells on the edge of the table is the table's padding for that side, plus the relevant border spacing distance. For example, on the right hand side, the distance is padding-right + horizontal border-spacing. The width of the table is the distance from the left inner padding edge to the right inner padding edge (including the border spacing but excluding padding and border). However, in HTML and XHTML1, the width of the <table> element is the distance from the left border edge to the right border edge.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Cell border spacing and table padding properties are not applied. The table display types are not supported.

2.2.1 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.3, Characters and case 

V0175:

The specification states:

All CSS syntax is case-insensitive within the ASCII range (i.e., [a-z] and [A-Z] are equivalent), except for parts that are not under the control of CSS. For example, the case-sensitivity of values of the HTML attributes "id" and "class", of font names, and of URIs lies outside the scope of this specification. Note in particular that element names are case-insensitive in HTML, but case-sensitive in XML.

id, class, and attribute selector matching is case-insensitive and does not respect the HTML 4.01 case sensitivity.

V0176:

The specification states:

In CSS, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs in selectors) can contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters U+00A1 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore (_); they cannot start with a digit, or a hyphen followed by a digit. Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646 character as a numeric code (see next item). For instance, the identifier "B&W?" may be written as "B\&W\?" or "B\26 W\3F".

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Attribute selectors can begin with digits.

V0177:

The specification states:

First, inside a string, a backslash followed by a newline is ignored (i.e., the string is deemed not to contain either the backslash or the newline).

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Strings with escaped newline characters are not treated as single whole strings.

V0178:

The specification states:

Third, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters they cannot easily put in a document. In this case, the backslash is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which stand for the ISO 10646 ([ISO-10646]) character with that number, which must not be zero. (It is undefined in CSS 2.1 what happens if a style sheet does contain a character with Unicode codepoint zero.) If a character in the range [0-9a-fA-F] follows the hexadecimal number, the end of the number needs to be made clear. There are two ways to do that:

1. with a space (or other white space character): "\26 B" ("&B"). In this case, user agents should treat a "CR/LF" pair (U+000D/U+000A) as a single white space character. 

2. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits: "\000026B" ("&B") 

In fact, these two methods may be combined. Only one white space character is ignored after a hexadecimal escape. Note that this means that a "real" space after the escape sequence must itself either be escaped or doubled.

Escaped character sequences (less than six hex digits) that are terminated by tabs and line feed characters are not supported.

2.2.2 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.5, At-rules 

V0179:

The specification states:

At-rules start with an at-keyword, an '@' character followed immediately by an identifier (for example, '@import', '@page').

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

At-rules that start with the at character (@) followed immediately by spaces, tabs, numbers, dashes, or other special characters are ignored and do not allow the actual keyword command to be executed.

2.2.3 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.6, Blocks 

V0180:

The specification states:

A block starts with a left curly brace ({) and ends with the matching right curly brace (}). In between there may be any tokens, except that parentheses (( )), brackets ([ ]), and braces ({ }) must always occur in matching pairs and may be nested. Single (') and double quotes (") must also occur in matching pairs, and characters between them are parsed as a string. See Tokenization above for the definition of a string.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••Nested blocks and strings are not parsed correctly.
••Blocks and strings with terminating pairs that do not exist or are not matched are ignored.

••Blocks and strings with matching terminating pairs of square brackets are parsed; the brackets do not affect the parsing of the rule.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

••Parsing is interrupted when a block, a curly brace, or a parenthesis is encountered before the body of the rule is completely defined after the first curly brace of the rule.

2.2.4 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.7, Rule sets, declaration blocks, and selectors

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Bad or empty selectors are not ignored.

V0182:

The specification states:

CSS 2.1 gives a special meaning to the comma (,) in selectors. However, since it is not known if the comma may acquire other meanings in future updates of CSS, the whole statement should be ignored if there is an error anywhere in the selector, even though the rest of the selector may look reasonable in CSS 2.1.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Bad selector declarations are not ignored.

2.2.5 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.1.8, Declarations and properties 

V0183:

The specification states:

A declaration is either empty or consists of a property name, followed by a colon (:), followed by a property value. Around each of these there may be white space.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Bad selector declarations are not ignored.

V0184:

The specification states:

A user agent must ignore a declaration with an invalid property name or an invalid value. Every CSS property has its own syntactic and semantic restrictions on

the values it accepts.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Invalid values are not ignored and cause the rule to fail. Such invalid values include spaces, slashes, and valid keywords. Invalid values that are functions are also included.

Malformed declarations. User agents must handle unexpected tokens encountered while parsing a declaration by reading until the end of the declaration, while observing the rules for matching pairs of (), [], {}, "", and '', and correctly handling

escapes. For example, a malformed declaration may be missing a property name, colon (:), or property value. The following are all equivalent:

p { color:green }

p { color:green; color }  /* malformed declaration missing ':', value */

p { color:red;
color; color:green }
/* same with expected recovery */
p { color:green;
color: } /* malformed

p { color:red;
color:; color:green }
/* same with expected recovery */
p { color:green;
color{;color:maroon} } /* unexpected tokens { } */
p { color:red;
color{;color:maroon}; color:green } /* same with recovery */

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••Malformed rules with a semicolon before a property are not ignored.

••Nested malformed declarations are applied, while the correct rules that follow the declaration are ignored.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Blocks and strings are parsed without matching terminating pairs. V0186:

The specification states:

Unexpected end of style sheet

User agents must close all open constructs (for example: blocks, parentheses, brackets, rules, strings, and comments) at the end of the style sheet.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Open parentheses, open strings, and open rules are not closed at the end of the style sheet. V0187:

The specification states:

Unexpected end of string

User agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line, but then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string was found.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The parser drops the rule when it encounters an unterminated string and does not continue to the next semicolon (;).

2.2.7 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.2, Lengths 

C0001:

The specification states:

The x-height of a font can be found in different ways. Some fonts contain reliable metrics for the x-height. If reliable font metrics are not available, UAs may determine the x-height from the height of a lowercase glyph. One possible heuristic is to look at how far the glyph for the lowercase "o" extends below the baseline, and subtract that value from the top of its bounding box. In the cases where it is impossible or impractical to determine the x-height, a value of 0.5em should be used.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The x-height of a font is always equal to 0.5 em.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

The x-height is computed from font metrics and varies by font.

C0002:

The specification states:

Child elements do not inherit the relative values specified for their parent; they inherit the computed values.


 In the following rules, the computed 'text-indent' value of "h1" elements will be 36px, not 45px, if "h1" is a child of the "body" element.

body {

font-size: 12px;

text-indent: 3em;  /* i.e., 36px */

}

h1 { font-size: 15px }

Absolute length units are fixed in relation to each other. They are mainly useful when the output environment is known. The absolute units consist of the physical units (in, cm, mm, pt, pc) and the px unit:

•in: inches — 1in is equal to 2.54cm.

•cm: centimeters •mm: millimeters

•pt: points — the points used by CSS are equal to 1/72nd of 1in. •pc: picas — 1pc is equal to 12pt.

•px: pixel units — 1px is equal to 0.75pt.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The "px" unit always equals 1/96 of the "in" unit, regardless of the physical resolution of the viewing device. However, Internet Explorer allows the user to zoom the page display size up or down. This changes the relationship between logical CSS pixels and physical pixels. For example, at 100 percent zoom, 1 CSS pixel equals 1 display device pixel, and at 125 percent zoom, 1 CSS pixel equals 1.25 device pixels. When printing, 1 CSS pixel equals 1/96 inch and is then converted to the actual

2.2.8 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 4.3.4, URLs and URIs 

V0188:

The specification states:

The format of a URI value is 'url(' followed by optional white space followed by an optional single quote (') or double quote (") character followed by the URI itself, followed by an optional single quote (') or double quote (") character followed by optional white space followed by ')'. The two quote characters must be the same.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Spaces are incorrectly allowed between a function name (such as URL) and the opening parenthesis.

The specification states:

Some characters appearing in an unquoted URI, such as parentheses, white

space characters, single quotes (') and double quotes ("), must be escaped with a backslash so that the resulting URI value is a URI token: '\(', '\)'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The ability to escape characters with a backslash in a URI is not supported.

Counters are denoted by case-sensitive identifiers (see the 'counter-increment' and 'counter-reset' properties). To refer to the value of a counter, the notation 'counter(<identifier>)' or 'counter(<identifier>, <'list-style-type'>)', with optional white space separating the tokens, is used.

A string cannot directly contain a newline. To include a newline in a string, use an escape representing the line feed character in ISO-10646 (U+000A), such as "\A" or "\00000a". This character represents the generic notion of "newline" in CSS.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Strings with escaped newlines are not supported.

Release: July 25, 2012

Interactive user agents sometimes change the rendering in response to user actions. CSS provides three pseudo-classes for common cases:

The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element (with some pointing device), but does not activate it. For example, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the cursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element. User agents not supporting interactive media do not have to support this pseudo-class. Some conforming user agents supporting interactive media may not be able to support this pseudo-class (e.g., a pen device).

The :active pseudo-class applies while an element is being activated by the user. For example, between the times the user presses the mouse button and releases it.

The :focus pseudo-class applies while an element has the focus (accepts keyboard events or other forms of text input).

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The :focus and :active pseudo-classes are not supported for any elements other than <a>.

IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The :focus pseudo-class is not supported when followed by a combinator.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The :hover pseudo-class applies to an element only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the content of that element’s box.

2.2.13 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 5.12.2, The :first-letter pseudo-element 

C0003:

The specification states:

If an element is a list item ('display: list-item'), the ':first-letter' applies to the first letter in the principal box after the marker. UAs may ignore ':first-letter' on list items with 'list-style-position: inside'. If an element has ':before' or ':after' content, the ':first-letter applies to the first letter of the element including that content.

E.g., after the rule 'p:before {content: "Note: "}', the selector 'p:first-letter' matches the "N" of "Note".

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The :first-letter pseudo-class is not ignored on list items with list-style-position:inside. C0004:

The specification states:

If the letters that would form the first-letter are not in the same element, such as "'T" in <p>'<em>T..., the UA may create a first-letter pseudo-element from one of the elements, both elements, or simply not create a pseudo-element.

}

</style>

</head>

<body>

<div>"<em>T</em>"</div>

The user agent cannot change positioning to anything other than static in these modes.

2.2.22 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.4.2, Inline formatting contexts 

V0206:

The specification states:

A line box is always tall enough for all of the boxes it contains. However, it may be taller than the tallest box it contains (if, for example, boxes are aligned so that baselines line up). When the height of a box B is less than the height of the line box containing it, the vertical alignment of B within the line box is determined by the 'vertical-align' property. When several inline level boxes cannot fit horizontally within a single line box, they are distributed among two or more vertically-stacked line boxes. Thus, a paragraph is a vertical stack of line boxes. Line boxes are stacked with no vertical separation and they never overlap.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••When the height of the inner box is less than the height of the line box containing it, the height of the inner box is clipped and is not preserved.

••Characters are not placed in the center of the inner box when they are displayed, but are clipped from the bottom up.

The float property is incorrectly applied to absolutely positioned elements.

V0208:

The specification states:

4. A floating box's outer top may not be higher than the top of its containing block. When the float occurs between two collapsing margins, the float is positioned as if it had an otherwise empty anonymous block parent taking part in the flow. The position of such a parent is defined by the rules in the section on margin collapsing.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

A floated element that occurs between two margins that would otherwise collapse prevents the margin from collapsing.

2.2.24 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.6, Absolute positioning 

V0209:

The specification states:

However, the contents of an absolutely positioned element do not flow around any other boxes.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

An absolutely positioned element does flow around other boxes.

2.2.25 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 9.7, Relationships between 'display', 'position', and 'float'

V0210:

The specification states:

The three properties that affect box generation and layout — 'display', 'position', and 'float' — interact as follows:

If 'display' has the value 'none', then 'position' and 'float' do not apply. In this case, the element generates no box.

Otherwise, if 'position' has the value 'absolute' or 'fixed', the box is absolutely positioned, the computed value of 'float' is 'none', and display is set according to the table below. The position of the box will be determined by the 'top', 'right', 'bottom' and 'left' properties and the box's containing block.

Otherwise, if 'float' has a value other than 'none', the box is floated and 'display' is set according to the table below.

Otherwise, if the element is the root element, 'display' is set according to the table below.

Otherwise, the remaining 'display' property values apply as specified.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The fixed value of the position property is not supported.

containing block is formed by the content edge of the nearest

block container ancestor box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

When the position is static, the containing block is not formed by the content edge of the nearest block-level ancestor.

V0212:

If the element has 'position: fixed', the containing block is established by the viewport in the case of continuous media or the page area in the case of paged media.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The position: fixed element is not supported.

V0213:

The specification states:

If the element has 'position: absolute', the containing block is established by the nearest ancestor with a 'position' of 'absolute', 'relative' or 'fixed', in the following way:

1. In the case that the ancestor is an inline element, the containing block is the bounding box around the padding boxes of the first and the last inline boxes generated for that element. In CSS 2.1, if the inline element is split across multiple lines, the containing block is undefined. 

2. Otherwise, the containing block is formed by the padding edge of the ancestor. 

If there is no such ancestor, the containing block is the initial containing block.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The box model does not respect the inequality defined in this section.

V0218:

The specification states:

If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', their used values are equal. This horizontally centers the element with respect to the edges of the containing block.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

When both margin-left and margin-right are auto, margin-left takes precedence when in RTL, and margin-right takes precedence when in LTR. This, in effect, consumes all of the available margin space that should be distributed equally between margin-left and margin-right.

V0219:

The specification states:

The used value of 'width' is determined as for inline replaced elements. Then the rules for non-replaced block-level elements are applied to determine the margins.

1. 'left' and 'width' are 'auto' and 'right' is not 'auto', then the width is shrink-to-fit. Then solve for 'left' 

2. 'left' and 'right' are 'auto' and 'width' is not 'auto', then if the 'direction' property of the element establishing the static-position containing block is 'ltr' set 'left' to the static position, otherwise set 'right' to the static position. 

Then solve for 'left' (if 'direction is 'rtl') or 'right' (if 'direction' is 'ltr'). 

3. 'width' and 'right' are 'auto' and 'left' is not 'auto', then the width is shrink-to-fit . Then solve for 'right'

Release: July 25, 2012

The percentage value of the min-width and the max-width properties is not supported. V0224:

The specification states:

Negative values for 'min-width' and 'max-width' are illegal.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The inherit value of the min-width and max-width properties is not supported.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The min-width and max-width properties are not supported; therefore specific values (or restrictions on values) are also not supported.

V0225:

The specification states:

The following algorithm describes how the two properties influence the used value of the 'width' property:

The tentative used width is calculated (without 'min-width' and 'max-width') following the rules under "Calculating widths and margins" above.

If the tentative used width is greater than 'max-width', the rules above are applied again, but this time using the computed value of 'max-width' as the computed value for 'width'.

If the resulting width is smaller than 'min-width', the rules above are applied again, but this time using the value of 'min-width' as the computed value for 'width'.

These steps do not affect the real computed values of the above properties.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The min-width and the max-width properties are not supported.

V0226:

The specification states:

However, for replaced elements with an intrinsic ratio and both 'width' and 'height' specified as 'auto', the algorithm is as follows:

Select from the table the resolved height and width values for the appropriate constraint violation. Take the max-width and max-height as max(min, max) so that min ≤ max holds true. In this table w and h stand for the results of the width and height computations ignoring the 'min-width', 'min-height', 'max-width' and 'max-height' properties. Normally these are the intrinsic width and height, but they may not be in the case of replaced elements with intrinsic ratios.

Note: In cases where an explicit width or height is set and the other dimension is auto, applying a minimum or maximum constraint on the auto side can cause an over-constrained situation. The spec is clear in the behavior but it might not be what

Then apply the rules under "Calculating widths and margins" above, as if 'width' were computed as this value.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••The min-height and max-height properties are not supported.

••The rules that are captured in the table in this section are applied if the width OR the height values are set to auto, rather than only when BOTH values are set to auto.

V0227:

The specification states:

'height'

Initial:	auto

Applies to:	all elements but non-replaced inline elements, table

columns, and column groups

Inherited:	no

Percentages:	see prose

This property specifies the content height of boxes

.

This property does not apply to non-replaced inline elements. See the section on computing heights and margins for non-replaced inline elements for the rules used instead.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The height property is not applied to elements that have the display property set to table-row, table, inline-table, table-column, or table-column-group.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

The height property is not applied to elements that have the display property set to table-row-group, table-header-group, or table-footer-group.

V0228:

The specification states:

<percentage>

Specifies a percentage height. The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the value computes to 'auto'. A percentage height on the root element is relative to the initial containing block.

Note: For absolutely positioned elements whose containing block is based on a block-level element, the percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the padding box of that element. This is a change from CSS1, where the percentage was always calculated with respect to the content box of the parent element."

Quirks Mode and IE7 Modes (All Versions)

For absolutely positioned elements with a percentage height whose containing block is based on a block-level element, the percentage is calculated with respect to the content box of the element, and not to its padding box of the element.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The percentage height of the root element is ignored and returned as the full size of the initial containing block (that is, all percent values return the full height of the initial containing block).

All Document Modes (All Versions)

If the height of a cell is specified, child elements with a percentage height will be at most as high as the cell's specified height even if the cell's height computes to a higher value.

2.2.34 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.6.1, Inline, non-replaced elements 

V0229:

The specification states:

The 'height' property does not apply. The height of the content area should be based on the font, but this specification does not specify how.

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The height property is applied to inline non-replaced elements.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The vertical padding, border, and margin of an inline non-replaced box start at the top and bottom of the line-height.

2.2.35 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.6.3, Block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' computes to 'visible'

V0232:

The specification states:

If it has block-level children, the height is the distance between the top border-edge of the topmost block-level child box that does not have margins collapsed through it and the bottom border-edge of the bottommost block-level child box that does not have margins collapsed through it. However, if the element has a non-zero top padding and/or top border, or is the root element, then the content starts at the top margin edge of the topmost child. (The first case expresses the fact that the top and bottom margins of the element collapse with those of the topmost and bottommost children, while in the second case the presence of the padding/border prevents the top margins from collapsing.) Similarly, if the bottom margin of the block does not collapse with the bottom margin of its last in-flow child, then the content ends at the bottom margin edge of the bottommost child.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Margins do not collapse if a value is specified for either padding or border. The computed height includes the non-collapsed margin.

2.2.36 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 10.6.5, Absolutely positioned, replaced elements

V0233:

The specification states:

This situation is similar to the previous one, except that the element has an intrinsic height. The sequence of substitutions is now:

1. The used value of 'height' is determined as for inline replaced elements. If 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' is specified as 'auto' its used value is determined by the rules below. 

2. If both 'top' and 'bottom' have the value 'auto', replace 'top' with the element's static position. 

3. If 'bottom' is 'auto', replace any 'auto' on 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' with '0'. 

4. If at this point both 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom' are still 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two margins must get equal values. 

5. If at this point there is only one 'auto' left, solve the equation for that value. 

6. If at this point the values are over-constrained, ignore the value for 'bottom'

V0238:

The specification states:

Although margins, borders, and padding of non-replaced elements do not enter into the line box calculation, they are still rendered around inline boxes. This means that if the height specified by 'line-height' is less than the content height of contained boxes, backgrounds and colors of padding and borders may "bleed" into adjoining line boxes. User agents should render the boxes in document order. This will cause the borders on subsequent lines to paint over the borders and text of previous lines.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••Backgrounds, padding colors, and borders are clipped to the bottom of the content box.

••Backgrounds, padding colors, and borders are also clipped to the top of the content box if the value of the box is anything other than auto.

The vertical-align property of the table-cell elements is not supported.

V0243:

The specification states:

The following values align the element relative to the line box. Since the element may have children aligned relative to it (which in turn may have descendants aligned relative to them), these values use the bounds of the aligned subtree. The aligned subtree of an inline element contains that element and the aligned subtrees of all children inline elements whose computed 'vertical-align' value is not 'top' or 'bottom'. The top of the aligned subtree is the highest of the tops of the boxes in the subtree, and the bottom is analogous.

top

Align the top of the aligned subtree with the top of the line box.

bottom

Align the bottom of the aligned subtree with the bottom of the line box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The vertical-align property of the table-cell elements is not supported.

V0244:

The specification states:

The baseline of an 'inline-block' is the baseline of its last line box in the normal flow, unless it has either no in-flow line boxes or if its 'overflow' property has a computed value other than 'visible', in which case the baseline is the bottom margin edge.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

scroll

This value indicates that the content is clipped and that if the user agent uses a scrolling mechanism that is visible on the screen (such as a scroll bar or a panner), that mechanism should be displayed for a box whether or not any of its content is clipped. This avoids any problem with scrollbars appearing and disappearing in a dynamic environment. When this value is specified and the target medium is 'print', overflowing content may be printed.

V0259:

The specification states:

If 'white-space' is set to 'pre' or 'pre-wrap', any sequence of spaces (U+0020) unbroken by an element boundary is treated as a sequence of non-breaking spaces. However, for 'pre-wrap', a line breaking opportunity exists at the end of the sequence.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The pre-wrap value of the white-space property is not supported, and is treated as normal so that sequences of spaces are collapsed.

V0260:

The specification states:

As each line is laid out,

1. If a space (U+0020) at the beginning of a line has 'white-space' set to 'normal', 'nowrap', or 'pre-line', it is removed.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

A space at the beginning of the line is removed if the white-space property is set to pre-wrap.

2.2.53 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.2, The CSS table model 

V0262:

The specification states:

table (In HTML: TABLE)

Specifies that an element defines a block-level table: it is a rectangular block that participates in a block formatting context.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The table value of the display property is not supported.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Any content of an element that has its display property set to none is not properly collected into the correct cells and extra anonymous tables are created.

table-row-group (In HTML: TBODY)

Specifies that an element groups one or more rows.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The table-row-group value of the display property is not supported.

V0266:

The specification states:

table-header-group (In HTML: THEAD)

Like 'table-row-group', but for visual formatting, the row group is always displayed before all other rows and row groups and after any top captions. Print user agents may repeat header rows on each page spanned by a table. If a table contains multiple elements with 'display: table-header-group', only the first is rendered as a header; the others are treated as if they had 'display: table-row-group'.

The table-cell value of the display property is not supported.

V0270:

The specification states:

Replaced elements with these 'display' values are treated as their given display types during layout. For example, an image that is set to 'display: table-cell' will fill the available cell space, and its dimensions might contribute towards the table sizing algorithms, as with an ordinary cell.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The table-related values of the display property are not supported.

V0271:

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The table-column and table-column-group values of the display property are not supported. C0026:

The specification states:

User agents may ignore these 'display' property values for HTML table elements, since HTML tables may be rendered using other algorithms intended for backwards compatible rendering. However, this is not meant to discourage the use of 'display: table' on other, non-table elements in HTML.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The display property values of HTML table elements are ignored.

2.2.54 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.4, Tables in the visual formatting model 

V0272:

The specification states:

In terms of the visual formatting model, a table can behave like a block-level (for 'display: table') or inline-level (for 'display: inline-table') element.

In both cases, the table generates a principal block box called the table wrapper

box that contains the table box itself and any caption boxes (in document order). The table box is a block-level box that contains the table's internal table boxes. The caption boxes are block-level boxes that retain their own content, padding, margin, and border areas, and are rendered as normal block boxes inside the table wrapper box. Whether the caption boxes are placed before or after the table box is decided by the 'caption-side' property, as described below.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The table-element values of the display property are not supported; therefore display:table and display:inline-table are not supported.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The width and height of table boxes of table captions have no effect on the width and height of table boxes.

2.2.55 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.4.1, Caption position and alignment

Computed value:	as specified

This property specifies the position of the caption box with respect to the table box. Values have the following meanings:

top

Positions the caption box above the table box.

bottom

Positions the caption box below the table box.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The caption-side property is not supported.

2.2.56 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5, Visual layout of table contents 

C0027:

The specification states:

Cells may span several rows or columns… If this position would cause a column-spanning cell to overlap a row-spanning cell from a prior row, CSS does not define the results: implementations may either overlap the cells (as is done in many HTML

implementations) or may shift the later cell to the right to avoid such overlap.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

If a column-spanning cell overlaps with a row-spanning cell, the cells are overlapped. V0274:

The specification states:

Note. Positioning and floating of table cells can cause them not to be table cells anymore, according to the rules in section 9.7. When floating is used, the rules on anonymous table objects may cause an anonymous cell object to be created as well.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The floating cell is removed from the table, but is not replaced with an empty cell.

2.2.57 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.1, Table layers and transparency

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Missing cells that have content are treated as anonymous table-rows, not cells.

2.2.58 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.2.1, Fixed table layout 

V0276:

The specification states:

The width of the table is then the greater of the value of the 'width' property for the table element and the sum of the column widths (plus cell spacing or borders). If the table is wider than the columns, the extra space should be distributed over the columns.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border-spacing property is not supported, so if a border-spacing value is specified it will not be taken into consideration when the table width is calculated. This includes when the border spacing is set to 0.

C0028:

The specification states:

If a subsequent row has more columns than the greater of the number determined by the table-column elements and the number determined by the first row, then additional columns may not be rendered. CSS 2.1 does not define the width of the columns and the table if they are rendered. When using 'table-layout: fixed', authors should not omit columns from the first row.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

In a fixed-layout table, extra columns are rendered.

2.2.59 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.3, Table height algorithms 

V0277:

The specification states:

The height of a table is given by the 'height' property for the 'table' or 'inline-table' element. A value of 'auto' means that the height is the sum of the row heights plus any cell spacing or borders. Any other value is treated as a minimum height. CSS 2.1 does not define how extra space is distributed when the 'height' property causes the table to be taller than it otherwise would be. Note. Future updates of CSS may specify this further.

2.2.60 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.5.5, Dynamic row and column effects 

V0278:

The specification states:

The ‘visibility’ property takes the value 'collapse' for row, row group, column, and column group elements. This value causes the entire row or column to be removed from the display, and the space normally taken up by the row or column to be made available for other content. Contents of spanned rows and columns that intersect the collapsed column or row are clipped. The suppression of the row or column, however, does not otherwise affect the layout of the table. This allows dynamic effects to remove table rows or columns without forcing a re-layout of the table in order to account for the potential change in column constraints.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The visibility property is ignored.

2.2.61 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.6, Borders

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border-spacing property is not supported.

V0281:

The specification states:

In this model, each cell has an individual border. The 'border-spacing' property specifies the distance between the borders of adjoining cells. In this space, the row, column, row group, and column group backgrounds are invisible, allowing the table background to show through. Rows, columns, row groups, and column groups cannot have borders (i.e., user agents must ignore the border properties for those elements).

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border-spacing property is not supported.

2.2.63 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.6.1.1, Borders and Backgrounds around empty cells: the 'empty-cells' property

Quirks Mode (All Versions)

The empty-cells property of table-cell elements is not supported.

IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The empty-cells property applies to inline elements.

The specification states:

A value of 'hide' means that no borders or backgrounds are drawn around/behind empty cells (see point 6 in 17.5.1). Furthermore, if all the cells in a row have a value of 'hide' and have no visible content, then the row has zero height and there is vertical border-spacing on only one side of the row.

The empty-cells property is not supported, so empty cells will always render as if they have a value of hide. If all cells in a row are empty, that row will not appear.

IE8 Mode and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

If all cells in a row are empty and the empty-cells property is set to hide, space will still be reserved for that row.

2.2.64 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.6.2, The collapsing border model 

V0284:

The specification states:

UAs must compute an initial left and right border width for the table by examining the first and last cells in the first row of the table. The left border width of the table is half of the first cell's collapsed left border, and the right border width of the table is half of the last cell's collapsed right border. If subsequent rows have larger collapsed left and right borders, then any excess spills into the margin area of the table.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••If a table has a border set, that border overrides the cell border on the table edges.

••If there is a cell border but no table border, the border width is not divided in half when calculating the border width in the collapsed model.

V0285:

The specification states:

The top border width of the table is computed by examining all cells who collapse their top borders with the top border of the table. The top border width of the table is equal to half of the maximum collapsed top border. The bottom border width is computed by examining all cells whose bottom borders collapse with the bottom of the table. The bottom border width is equal to half of the maximum collapsed bottom border.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The top and bottom widths of the table border are not computed via the specified methods. Instead, the border widths are 0.

V0286:

The specification states:

Any borders that spill into the margin are taken into account when determining if the table overflows some ancestor (see 'overflow').

2.2.65 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.6.2.1, Border conflict resolution 

V0287:

The specification states:

In the collapsing border model, borders at every edge of every cell may be specified by border properties on a variety of elements that meet at that edge (cells, rows, row groups, columns, column groups, and the table itself), and these borders may vary in width, style, and color.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The border property is not supported for the following elements:

table-row-group (tbody) table-row (tr) table-column (col)

table-column-group (colgroup)

V0288:

The specification states:

1. Borders with the 'border-style' of 'hidden' take precedence over all other conflicting borders. Any border with this value suppresses all borders at this location.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The hidden value does not take precedence over any other border style. Borders are displayed at this location.

V0289:

The specification states:

3. If none of the styles are 'hidden' and at least one of them is not 'none', then narrow borders are discarded in favor of wider ones. If several have the same 'border-width' then styles are preferred in this order: 'double', 'solid', 'dashed', 'dotted', 'ridge', 'outset', 'groove', and the lowest: 'inset'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Border conflicts among borders of the same thickness are not resolved. The border for each cell is drawn beginning from left to right, from the top row to the bottom row. After the first cell border in the row is drawn, the next cell border is drawn over the previous border. In some cases, this behavior results in a combined border. For example, if the cell on the left has a solid red border and the adjacent cell on the right has a double black border, the border the two cells share appears as a

double black border with red in the space between the two lines. However, if the cell on the left has the double border and the cell on the right has the solid red border, the border the two cells share appears as a solid red border. Note that in rtl mode, the cell borders are drawn from right to left, top to bottom so that the border that appears on top is reversed.

V0290:

The specification states:

4. If border styles differ only in color, then a style set on a cell wins over one on a row, which wins over a row group, column, column group and, lastly, table. When two elements of the same type conflict, then the one further to the left (if the table's 'direction' is 'ltr'; right, if it is 'rtl') and further to the top wins.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Borders that are set on the table will win over those that are set on the cells.

2.2.66 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 17.6.3, Border styles 

V0291:

The specification states:

Some of the values of the 'border-style' have different meanings in tables than for other elements. In the list below they are marked with an asterisk.

none

No border.

*hidden

Same as 'none', but in the collapsing border model, also inhibits any other border (see the section on border conflicts).

…

*inset

In the separated borders model, the border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas. In the collapsing border model, same as 'ridge'.

*outset

In the separated borders model, the border makes the entire box look as though it were coming out of the canvas. In the collapsing border model, same as 'groove'.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••In the collapsing border model, hidden behaves the same as none.

••In the collapsing border model, inset and outset behave the same as in the separated borders model.

2.2.67 [CSS-Level2-2009] Section 18.4, Dynamic outlines: the 'outline' property 

V0292:

The specification states:

The outline created with the outline properties is drawn "over" a box, i.e., the outline is always on top, and does not influence the position or size of the box, or of any other boxes. Therefore, displaying or suppressing outlines does not cause reflow or overflow.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The outline property is not supported.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

Outlines are drawn underneath positioned descendants.

V0293:

The specification states:

Outlines may be non-rectangular. For example, if the element is broken across several lines, the outline is the minimum outline that encloses all the element's boxes. In contrast to borders, the outline is not open at the line box's end or start, but is always fully connected if possible.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The outline property is not supported.

V0294:

The specification states:

The 'outline-color' accepts all colors, as well as the keyword 'invert'. 'Invert' is expected to perform a color inversion on the pixels on the screen. This is a common trick to ensure the focus border is visible, regardless of color background. Conformant UAs may ignore the 'invert' value on platforms that do not support color inversion of the pixels on the screen. If the UA does not support the 'invert' value then the initial value of the 'outline-color' property is the value of the 'color' property, similar to the initial value of the 'border-top-color' property.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The outline-color property is not supported.

V0295:

The specification states:

This specification does not define how multiple overlapping outlines are drawn, or how outlines are drawn for boxes that are partially obscured behind other elements. Note. Since the outline does not affect formatting (i.e., no space is left for it

Note In CSS2, a number immediately followed by an identifier is parsed as a DIMENSION token. However, CSS1 parses it as a number and an identifier. This means that in CSS1, the declaration font: 10pt/1.2serif is correct, as is font: 10pt/12pt serif; in CSS2, a space is required before 'serif'.

IE7 Mode, IE8 Mode, and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

A space is required between a number and an identifier.

2.3 Error Handling 

There are no additional considerations for error handling.

2.4 Security 

There are no additional security considerations.
