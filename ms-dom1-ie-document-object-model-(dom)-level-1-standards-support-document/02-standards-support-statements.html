2  Standards Support Statements

This section contains a full list of variations, clarifications, and extension points in the Microsoft implementation of  [DOM Level 1].

••Section  2.1 includes only those variations that violate a MUST requirement in the target specification.

••Section  2.2 describes further variations from MAY and SHOULD requirements.
••Section  2.3 identifies variations in error handling.
••Section  2.4 identifies variations that impact security

2.1 Normative Variations 

The following subsections detail the normative variations from MUST requirements in  [DOM Level 1].

2.1.1 [DOM Level 1] Section 1.2, Fundamental Interfaces 

V0001:

The specification states:

IDL Definition exception DOMException {

  unsigned short code; };

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The DOMException interface is not supported.

V0002:

The specification states:

While it is true that a Document object could fulfil this role, a Document object can potentially be a heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is really needed for this is a very lightweight object. DocumentFragment is such an object.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The DocumentFragment interface is derived from the Document interface. The createDocumentFragment method returns a full Document object.

V0003:

The specification states:

IDL Definition

interface DocumentFragment : Node {

Release: July 25, 2012

};

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The DocumentFragment interface is derived from the Document interface. The Document interface is derived from the Node interface.

V0004:

The specification states:

Method createElement

Creates an element of the type specified. Note that the instance returned implements the Element interface, so attributes can be specified directly on the returned object.

Parameters

tagName The name of the element type to instantiate. For XML, this is case-sensitive. For HTML, the tagName parameter may be provided in any case, but it must be mapped

to the canonical uppercase form by the DOM implementation.

Return Value

A new Element object.

Exceptions

DOMException

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name contains an invalid character.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The following variation apply:

••The createElement method is overloaded with one that takes no parameters. When no parameters are given, this method returns an element with a tagName of null.

••The createElement method accepts full element declaration strings that contain otherwise invalid characters for the tagName parameter. A parameter string such as "<div id='div1'>" would return a div element with an id of div1. An INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR exception is not raised in this case.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, IE8 Mode, and IE9 Mode (All Versions)

••When an element that contains an XMLNS declaration (such as <html XMLNS:mns='http://www.contoso.com'>) is specified for the tagName parameter, the value of the tagUrn property for the new element is set to the specified URI.

V0005:

The specification states:

interface Document : Node

Method createCDATASection

Creates a CDATASection node whose value is the specified string.

Parameters data

The data for the CDATASection contents.

Return Value

The new CDATASection object.

Exceptions

DOMException  NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The createCDATASection method of the Document interface is not supported.

V0006:

The specification states:

interface Document : Node

Method createProcessingInstruction

Creates a ProcessingInstruction node given the specified name and data strings.

Parameters target

The target part of the processing instruction. data  The data for the node.

Return Value

The new ProcessingInstruction object.

Exceptions

DOMException INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if an invalid character is specified. NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if this document is an HTML document.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The createProcessingInstruction method of the Document interface is not supported.

V0009:

The specification states:

Definition group

NodeType

An integer indicating which type of node this is.

Defined Constants

ELEMENT_NODE The node is a Element.

ATTRIBUTE_NODE The node is an Attr.

TEXT_NODE The node is a Text node.

CDATA_SECTION_NODE The node is a CDATASection.

ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE The node is an EntityReference.

ENTITY_NODE The node is an Entity.

PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE The node is a ProcessingInstruction.

COMMENT_NODE The node is a Comment.

DOCUMENT_NODE The node is a Document.

DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE The node is a DocumentType.

DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE The node is a DocumentFragment.

NOTATION_NODE The node is a Notation.

The values of nodeName, nodeValue, and attributes vary according to the node type as follows:

nodeName, nodeValue, attributes

Element	tagName, null, NamedNodeMap

Attr	name of attribute, value of attribute, null

Text	#text, content of the text node, null

••DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE

••DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE

••NOTATION_NODE

A document type declaration is treated as a Comment object instead of a DocumentType object

V0010:

The specification states:

Attribute nodeName

The name of this node, depending on its type; see the table above.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The nodeName property returns uppercase values except for elements with names that resemble namespaces (such as <test:elementName>) when a proprietary namespace has been declared. In this case, the nodeName property drops the element prefixes and does not return uppercase values.

V0011:

The specification states:

Attribute parentNode

The parent of this node. All nodes, except Document, DocumentFragment, and Attr may have a parent. However, if a node has just been created and not yet added to the tree, or if it has been removed from the tree, this is null.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

When an element without a parent has child nodes, an HTMLDocument object is created and set as the parent of that element.

V0012:

The specification states:

Attribute childNodes

A NodeList that contains all children of this node. If there are no children, this is a NodeList containing no nodes. The content of the returned NodeList is "live" in the sense that, for instance, changes to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the nodes returned by the NodeList accessors; it is not a static snapshot of the content of the node. This is true for every NodeList, including the ones returned by the getElementsByTagName method.

Release: July 25, 2012

Splitting multiple text nodes under an element using the splitText method can cause the childNodes collection update to be delayed. Other tree modifications cause the childNodes collection to synchronize again.

V0013:

The specification states:

Method

insertBefore Inserts the node newChild before the existing child node refChild. If refChild is null, insert newChild at the end of the list of children. If newChild is a DocumentFragment object, all of its children are inserted, in the same order, before refChild. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.

Parameters

newChild  The node to insert.

refChild The reference node, i.e., the node before which the new node must be inserted.

Return Value

The node being inserted.

Exceptions

DOMException HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not allow children of the type of the newChild node, or if the node to insert is one of this node's ancestors.

WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if newChild was created from a different document than the one that created this node.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly. NOT_FOUND_ERR: Raised if refChild is not a child of this node.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The conditions to trigger the exceptions HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR and WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR both result in an HRESULT 0x80070057, which creates a JavaScript Error message "Invalid argument."

certain types (those that have a "special" string value) cannot be stored as the names would clash. This is seen as preferable to allowing nodes to be aliased.

Parameters

arg A node to store in a named node map. The node will later be accessible using the value of the nodeName attribute of the node. If a node with that name is already present in the map, it is replaced by the new one.

Return Value

If the new Node replaces an existing node with the same name the previously existing Node is returned, otherwise null is returned.

Exceptions

DOMException WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if arg was created from a different document than the one that created the NamedNodeMap. NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this NamedNodeMap is readonly. INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR: Raised if arg is an Attr that is already an attribute of another Element object. The DOM user must explicitly clone Attr nodes to re-use them in other elements.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••The WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR exception is not raised if the arg parameter was created from a document other than the one that created NamedNodeMap.

••Instead of the INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR exception, if arg is an Attr that is already an attribute of another Element object, the setNamedItem method of the Node interface raises a JSError exception with an error message of "Invalid argument" and an HRESULT of 0x80070057.

V0018:

The specification states:

Method

item Returns the indexth item in the map. If index is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the map, this returns null.

Parameters

index  Index into the map.

Return Value

The node at the indexth position in the NamedNodeMap, or null if that is not a valid index.

This method raises no exceptions.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

Instead of returning null when the index parameter is greater than the number of nodes in the map, the item method of the Node interface throws a JSError exception with an error message of
"Invalid argument" and an HRESULT of 0x80070057.

Method

substringData Extracts a range of data from the node.

Parameters

offset Start offset of substring to extract. count The number of characters to extract.

Return Value

The specified substring. If the sum of offset and count exceeds the length, then all characters to the end of the data are returned.

Exceptions

DOMException INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified offset is negative or greater than the number of characters in data, or if the specified count is negative. DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified range of text does not fit into a DOMString.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••No exception is raised if the offset is greater than the number of 16-bit units in the data.

••Instead of the INDEX_SIZE_ERR DOMException, if the specified offset is negative or greater than the number of characters in the data or the specified count is negative, the substringData method of the Node interface raises a JScript Error exception with an error message of "Invalid argument" and an HRESULT of 0x80070057.

V0020:

The specification states:

Attribute specified

If this attribute was explicitly given a value in the original document, this is true; otherwise, it is false. Note that the implementation is in charge of this attribute, not the user. If the user changes the value of the attribute (even if it ends up having the same value as the default value) then the specified flag is automatically flipped to true. To re-specify the attribute as the default value from the DTD, the user must delete the attribute. The implementation will then make a new attribute available with specified set to false and the default value (if one exists). In summary:

- If the attribute has an assigned value in the document then specified is true, and the value is the assigned value. 

- If the attribute has no assigned value in the document and has a default value in the DTD, then specified is false, and the value is the default value in the DTD. 

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The value of the specified attribute is not automatically flipped when the associated attribute is changed.

Internet Explorer Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the Element interface inherits from Node, the generic Node interface method getAttributes may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an element. There are methods on the Element interface to retrieve either an Attr object by name or an attribute value by name. In XML, where an attribute value may contain entity references, an Attr object should be retrieved to examine the possibly fairly complex sub-tree representing the attribute value. On the other hand, in HTML, where all attributes have simple string values, methods to directly access an attribute value can safely be used as a convenience.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The getAttributes method is not supported.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

Attribute subtrees are not supported.

IE9 Mode and IE10 Mode (All Versions)

For any given attribute, only a single, immutable text node is supported as the subtree. V0022:

The specification states:

Attribute tagName

The name of the element. For example, in: <elementExample id="demo"> ...

</elementExample> ,tagName has the value "elementExample". Note that this is case-preserving in XML, as are all of the operations of the DOM. The HTML DOM returns the tagName of an HTML element in the canonical uppercase form, regardless of the case in the source HTML document.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The tagName property returns uppercase values except for elements with names that resemble namespaces (such as <test:elementName>) when a proprietary namespace has been declared. In this case, the tagName property drops the element prefixes and does not return uppercase values.

V0023:

The specification states:

Method

getAttribute Retrieves an attribute value by name.

Parameters

name  The name of the attribute to retrieve.

Return Value The Attr value as a string, or the empty string if that attribute does not have a specified or default value.

This method raises no exceptions.

Internet Explorer Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Standards Support Document

Copyright © 2012 Microsoft Corporation.

Release: July 25, 2012

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The getAttribute method supports a second parameter called iFlags. The iFlags parameter controls case sensitivity and object interpolation. By default, iFlags is set to 0, which indicates that the property search done by the getAttribute method is not case-sensitive and returns an interpolated value if the property is found.

V0024:

The specification states:

Method

setAttribute Adds a new attribute. If an attribute with that name is already present in the element, its value is changed to be that of the value parameter. This value is a simple string, it is not parsed as it is being set. So any markup (such as syntax to be recognized as an entity reference) is treated as literal text, and needs to be appropriately escaped by the implementation when it is written out. In order to assign an attribute value that contains entity references, the user must create an Attr node plus any Text and EntityReference nodes, build

the appropriate subtree, and use setAttributeNode to assign it as the value of an attribute.

Parameters

name  The name of the attribute to create or alter. value  Value to set in string form.

Exceptions DOMException INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name contains an invalid character.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

This method returns nothing.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••The setAttribute method assigns attributes in a case-sensitive manner (expected case-insensitive for HTML).

••The second parameter of the setAttribute method accepts only strings, not objects. An optional third parameter controls case sensitivity.

••Attributes that apply a boolean initial state to the associated DOM properties (for example, value and checked) are incorrectly associated with their live property rather than their default property. For example, the setAttribute method ('checked', 'checked') toggles the DOM checked property (the live view of a check box) rather than the defaultChecked property (initial value).

••The HTML style attribute and attributes that are event handlers do not apply their conditions when used with setAttribute.

••The setAttribute method requires DOM property names to apply effects for certain attribute names, such as className (instead of 'class'), htmlFor (instead of 'for'), and httpEquiv (instead of 'http-equiv').

The following variations apply:

••The removeAttribute method supports an additional parameter called iCaseSensitive. The iCaseSensitive parameter specifies whether to use a case-sensitive search to find the attribute. Removal of event handler attributes (such as onClick) or the style attribute does not cause the actual event handler to be removed, or the inline style to be removed.

••Default attributes are not re-created after the attribute is removed.

Method getElementsByTagName

Returns a NodeList of all descendant elements with a given tag name, in the order in which they would be encountered in a preorder traversal of the Element tree.

Parameters

name  The name of the tag to match on. The special value "*" matches all tags.

Return Value

A list of matching Element nodes.

This method raises no exceptions.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The following variations apply:

••When called on an object element, where the value "*" is passed in as the value of the name parameter, the getElementsByTagName method returns an empty NodeList.

••When called on an OBJECT element, where param is passed in as the value of the name parameter, the getElementsByTagName method returns a NodeList that contains all the PARAM elements in the document.

V0028:

The specification states:

Method splitText

Breaks this Text node into two Text nodes at the specified offset, keeping both in the tree as siblings. This node then only contains all the content up to the offset point. And a new Text node, which is inserted as the next sibling of this node, contains all the content at and after the offset point.

Parameters

offset  The offset at which to split, starting from 0.

Return Value

The new Text node.

Exceptions

DOMException INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified offset is negative or greater than the number of characters in data.

NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

Internet Explorer Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Standards Support Document

Release: July 25, 2012

Specifying a value of -1 for the index parameter causes the deleteRow method to remove the last row of the table. This behavior is expected in DOM L2 but not in DOM L1.

C0051:

The specification states:

Attribute align

Horizontal alignment of data in cell. See the align attribute definition in HTML 4.0.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The values char or justify are not recognized as valid choices for the align attribute in a TD element. If char or justify are set in HTML for a TD element, td.align evaluates to an empty string.

C0052:

The specification states:

Attribute bgColor

Cell background color. See the bgcolor attribute definition in HTML 4.0. This attribute is deprecated in HTML 4.0.

Quirks Mode and IE7 Mode (All Versions)

The value of the bgColor attribute in a TD element is always converted to a hexadecimal RGB value when it is stored in the DOM. For example, setting the bgColor attribute of a TD element to blue in HTML yields a value of #0000FF for the bgColor attribute when retrieved using the getAttribute method.

IE8 Mode, IE9 Mode, and IE10 Mode (All Versions)

The value of the bgColor attribute in a TD element remains the same as the author's original setting in HTML. For example, setting the bgColor attribute of a TD element to blue in HTML yields a value of blue when using the getAttribute method to retrieve the color.

However, the value of the bgColor property of the HTMLFontElement interface is stored in the DOM as a hexadecimal RGB value (for example, setting it to blue in HTML yields #0000FF for the color when retrieved using TD.bgColor).

C0053:

The specification states:

Attribute ch

Alignment character for cells in a column. See the char attribute definition in HTML 4.0.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The char attribute is not associated with the ch attribute in the DOM.

C0054:

The specification states:

Attribute chOff

Offset of alignment character. See the charoff attribute definition in HTML 4.0.

Quirks Mode, IE7 Mode, and IE8 Mode (All Versions)

The chOff attribute is not supported.

C0055:

The specification states:

Attribute height

Cell height. See the height attribute definition in HTML 4.0. This attribute is deprecated in HTML 4.0.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The value of the height attribute is serialized by dropping the "px" suffix when set in the DOM. For example, writing <td height="100px"> in markup, accessing td.height from the DOM, returns 100. However, percentage values are unmodified. For example, with <td height="100%"> in markup, the DOM returns 100%.

The specification states:

IE8 Mode, IE9 Mode, and IE10 Mode (All Versions)

If the value of the longdesc attribute or src attribute for the FRAME element is specified in HTML as a relative URI, the value is converted and stored as an absolute URI in the longDesc attribute or src attribute, respectively, of the HTMLFrameElement. If not already present, a slash is appended to the end of the URI when a file name is not specified.

interface HTMLFrameElement : HTMLElement

Attribute

noResize of type boolean

When true, forbid user from resizing frame. See the noresize attribute definition in HTML 4.0.

All Document Modes (All Versions)

The following clarifications apply:

••The value of the noresize attribute is stored as a string.

••This attribute is an expando. If the noresize attribute is assigned a value in HTML, that value is returned as the value of the noResize DOM attribute rather than the Boolean value true.

••If the noresize attribute is not specified in HTML, or is specified without a value, the noResize DOM attribute returns a value of undefined rather than a default Boolean value of false.

2.3 Error Handling 

There are no additional considerations for error handling.

2.4 Security 

There are no additional security considerations.
