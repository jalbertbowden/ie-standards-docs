1  Introduction

This document describes the level of support provided by Windows® Internet Explorer® for the

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Specification Version 1.0  [DOM Level 1], W3C Recommendation 1 October, 1998. Internet Explorer displays webpages written in HTML.

The  [DOM Level 1] specification may contain guidance for authors of HTML and XML documents, browser users and user agents (browser applications). Statements found in this document apply only to normative requirements in the specification targeted to user agents, not those targeted to authors.

1.1 Glossary 

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as described in  [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2 References 

References to Microsoft Open Specifications documentation do not include a publishing year because links are to the latest version of the technical documents, which are updated frequently. References to other documents include a publishing year when one is available.

1.2.1 Normative References 

We conduct frequent surveys of the normative references to assure their continued availability. If you have any issue with finding a normative reference, please contact  dochelp@microsoft.com. We will assist you in finding the relevant information. Please check the archive site,  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/E4BD6494-06AD-4aed-9823-445E921C9624, as an additional source.

In addition, each version of Internet Explorer implements multiple document modes, which can vary individually in their support of the standard. The following table lists the document modes available in each version of Internet Explorer:


Browser Version


Document Modes Supported
















Internet Explorer 7


Quirks mode





Standards mode






Internet Explorer 8


Quirks mode





IE7 mode





IE8 mode






Internet Explorer 9


Quirks mode





IE7 mode





IE8 mode





IE9 mode






Internet Explorer 10


Quirks mode





IE7 mode





IE8 mode





IE9 mode





IE10 Mode









Throughout this document, the document mode appears first followed by the browser version in parentheses. Only those document modes and versions of Internet Explorer for which there is a variation note will be listed. If the document mode is not listed, conformance to the specification can be assumed.

Note "Standards mode" in Internet Explorer 7 and "IE7 mode" in Internet Explorer 8 refer to the same document mode. "IE7 mode" is the preferred way of referring to this document mode across all versions of the browser.

1.4 Standards Support Requirements 

To conform to  [DOM Level 1], a user agent must implement all required portions of the specification. Any optional portions that have been implemented must also be implemented as described by the specification. Normative language is usually used to define both required and optional portions. (For more information, see  [RFC2119].)

The following table lists the sections of  [DOM Level 1] and whether they are considered normative or informative.

1.5 Notation 

The following notations are used in this document to differentiate between notes of clarification, variation from the specification, and extension points.


Notation


Explanation
















C####

This identifies a clarification of ambiguity in the target specification. This includes imprecise






statements, omitted information, discrepancies, and errata. This does not include data






formatting clarifications.







V####

This identifies an intended point of variability in the target specification such as the use of






MAY, SHOULD, or RECOMMENDED. (See  [RFC2119].) This does not include extensibility






points.







E####

Because the use of extensibility points (such as optional implementation-specific data) can






impair interoperability, this profile identifies such points in the target specification.
